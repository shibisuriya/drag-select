### Some usecases
Want to build an image cropper?
Want to mark objects on a image and send to a image processor or machine learning model.
Mark output from OCR engines like textract.
Facebook tag.
Google sheet comments.

## Borders and outlines

You can add borders to your drag select elements, but adding an outline is
not recommended since it overflows the container element.


## TO DOs
* Test using on dual monitor setup.
